### Bayesian models
1. Sampler.ipynb contains a bayesian sampler created from scratch to fit an Exponential distribution to some precipitation data from NOAA
2. sampler_pystan.ipynb generates the same exponential model but using pyStan library
3. sampler_pymc3.ipynb generates the same exponential model but using pymc3 library
